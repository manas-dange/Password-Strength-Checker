# Password Strength Checker

## Description
This is a simple GUI-based Password Strength Checker built using Python's Tkinter library. It evaluates password strength based on length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The program visually represents strength using a progress bar and an emoji-based indicator.

## Features
- Real-time password strength evaluation
- Progress bar indicating strength level
- Emoji-based feedback on password strength
- Simple and user-friendly UI

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This program is compatible with Python 3.

## Installation
1. Install Python (if not already installed) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Tkinter (usually included by default with Python):
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```
3. Ensure you have the `lock.ico` file in the same directory as the script (for the window icon).

## Running the Program in Python IDLE
1. Open Python IDLE.
2. Click on **File** > **Open** and select the script file.
3. Run the script by clicking **Run** > **Run Module** or pressing `F5`.

## How to Use
1. Enter a password in the input field.
2. The progress bar and emoji-based indicator will update in real time to show the password strength.
   - ðŸ˜¡ Weak
   - ðŸ˜¬ Medium

## Customization
- Modify the background color and fonts in the script for a personalized UI.
- Adjust the password strength criteria based on security needs.

## Troubleshooting
- If the window does not appear, ensure Tkinter is properly installed.
- If `lock.ico` is missing, either provide an icon file or remove the `iconbitmap` line.
