## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
1. Install Python (if not already installed) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Tkinter (usually included by default with Python):
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```
3. Ensure you have the `lock.ico` file in the same directory as the script (for the window icon).
4. Open Python IDLE:
   - Click on **File** > **Open** and select the script file.
   - Run the script by clicking **Run** > **Run Module** or pressing `F5`.

## ðŸ¤– Extra Features
- The UI has a **dark mode theme** for better aesthetics.
- Uses **custom fonts** for a visually appealing look.
- The application is lightweight and **runs smoothly** on most systems.

## Customization
- Modify the background color and fonts in the script for a personalized UI.
- Adjust the password strength criteria based on security needs.

## Troubleshooting
- If the window does not appear, ensure Tkinter is properly installed.
- If `lock.ico` is missing, either provide an icon file or remove the `iconbitmap` line.
